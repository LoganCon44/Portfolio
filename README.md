# Portfolio
Portfolio of projects I have completed for academic and other learning purposes.

# [Project 1: IBM Machine Learning Project](https://github.com/LoganCon44/Portfolio/blob/main/code%20files/IBM_Machine_Learning_Project.ipynb)
The goal of this project was to build machine learning models to predict whether a loan case will be paid off or not. I loaded a dataset from previous loan applications, analyzed and cleaned the data, and applied different classification algorithms such as k-Nearest Neighbor, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine, and Logistic Regression. When testing, I determined the accuracy of each model using Jaccard Index, F1 Score, and LogLoss.

# [Project 2: Finite Difference Model in Python](https://github.com/LoganCon44/Portfolio/blob/main/code%20files/Finite_Differences_Python.ipynb)
In this project I used the implicit finite difference model to determine the option prices for a given stock. I then used the option prices retrieved during backward walk to formulate a graph of said prices.

# [Project 3: IBM Data Science Python Project](https://github.com/LoganCon44/Portfolio/blob/main/code%20files/IBM_Python_Project.ipynb)
This project was part of the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate where I used yfinance to extract stock data and webscraping to extract revenue data for Tesla and GameStop. I then analyzed the data and plotted the revenue and stock data of both companies.

# [Project 4: P&L Attribution in Excel](https://github.com/LoganCon44/Portfolio/blob/main/code%20files/P%26L_Attribution.xlsx)
The objective of this project was to construct a P&L attribution from COB Jan 27 and COB Jan 26 for 100,000 850-strike TSLA calls that expired on Feb 4, 2022. This was done using formulas for the Black-Scholes greeks to determine the change in price of the TSLA calls.

# [Project 5: Finite Difference Models in Excel](https://github.com/LoganCon44/Portfolio/blob/main/code%20files/Finite_Differences.xlsx)
For this project I used the stock and options of Apple to determine the price of european call and put options. Using the explicit finite differences algorithm, I determined the price of the call and put options. I then compared the results to the values I recieved from Black-Scholes and Binomial Lattice methods.

# [Project 6: Analysis of Bonds in Excel](https://github.com/LoganCon44/Portfolio/blob/main/code%20files/Bonds_Data.xlsx)
In the first part of this project I used a 10-year bullet bond with semi-annual coupon payments to determine DV01 using discounted cash flows. I then utilized DV01 to calculate the modified duration and the modified duration to calculate the macaulay duration and convexity. Next, I used this to estimate the effect of 25 basis points changes. The second part of the project consideres a sequence of zero-coupon prices for bonds maturing in 1-5 years, I used these prices to calculate zero coupon yields, implied forward 1-year rates, and par coupons.
