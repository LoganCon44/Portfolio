# Portfolio
Portfolio of projects I have completed for academic and other learning purposes.

# [Project 1: Finite Difference Model in Python](https://github.com/LoganCon44/Portfolio/blob/main/code%20files/Finite_Differences_Python.ipynb)
In this project I used the implicit finite difference model to determine the option prices for a given stock. I then used the option prices retrieved during backward walk to formulate a graph of said prices.

# [Project 2: IBM Data Science Python Project](https://github.com/LoganCon44/Portfolio/blob/main/code%20files/IBM_Python_Project.ipynb)
This project was part of the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate where I used yfinance to extract stock data and webscraping to extract revenue data for Tesla and GameStop. I then analyzed the data and plotted the revenue and stock data of both companies.

# [Project 3: P&L Attribution in Excel](https://github.com/LoganCon44/Portfolio/blob/main/code%20files/P%26L_Attribution.xlsx)
The objective of this project is to construct a P&L attribution from COB Jan 27 and COB Jan 26 for 100,000 850-strike TSLA calls that expired on Feb 4, 2022. This was done using formulas for the Black-Scholes greeks to determine the change in price of the TSLA calls.

# [Project 4: Finite Difference Models in Excel](https://github.com/LoganCon44/Portfolio/blob/main/code%20files/Finite_Differences.xlsx)
For this project I used the stock and options of Apple to determine the price of european call and put options. Using the explicit finite differences algorithm I determined the price of the call and put options then compaired the results to the values I recieved from Black-Scholes and Binomial Lattice methods.
# [Project 5: Analysis of Bonds in Excel](https://github.com/LoganCon44/Portfolio/blob/main/code%20files/Bonds_Data.xlsx)
