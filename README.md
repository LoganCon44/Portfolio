# [Project 1: Finite Difference Model in Python](https://github.com/LoganCon44/Portfolio/blob/main/code%20files/Finite_Differences_Python.ipynb)
In this project I used the implicit finite difference model to determine the option prices for a given stock. I then used the option prices retrieved during backward walk to formulate a graph of said prices.
