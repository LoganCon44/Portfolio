# [Project 1: Finite Difference Model in Python](https://github.com/LoganCon44/Portfolio/blob/main/code%20files/Finite_Differences_Python.ipynb)
In this project I used the implicit finite difference model to determine the option prices for a given stock. I then used the option prices retrieved during backward walk to formulate a graph of said prices.

# [Project 2: IBM Data Science Python Project](https://github.com/LoganCon44/Portfolio/blob/main/code%20files/IBM_Python_Project.ipynb)
This project was part of the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate where I used yfinance to extract stock data and webscraping to extract revenue data for Tesla and GameStop. I then analyzed the data and plotted the revenue and stock data of both companies.
